---- Symfony2 enahancement ----

Requiem is a php Symfony 2 enhancement

It's a bundle so to install it simple download and install it under /Bundle/Requiem
folder of your Symfony 2.0 project.

For the moment the budle give you 3 features

[1] RequiemController

Using RequiemController instead of a normal controller you can declare service as member 
and directly use them so for example you can do a controller like this

use Bundle\Requiem\Services\RequiemController;

class TestController extends RequiemController {

  //automatic filled with the doctrine em
  public $entityService;

  //automatic filled with the request object
  public $requestService;

  public function indexAction() {    
    $query = $this->entityService->createQuery('SELECT u FROM TestBundle:User u WHERE u.email = "'.$this->requestService->get('email').'"');    
    ,,,
  }
}

[2] RestRequiemController

A special controller useful for rest. Colling it's handle method from the routing it directly call the right action based on the http method

rest:
    pattern: /rest
    defaults: { _controller: TestBundle:Test:handle }

use Bundle\Requiem\Services\RestRequiemController;

class TestController extends RestRequiemController {

  public $entityService;
  public $requestService;

  public function doGet() {    
    ,,,
  }

  public function doPost() {    
    ,,,
  }
}

[3] RequiemService

Extend this class to have a class with access to the container and the autobind like a RequiemController
